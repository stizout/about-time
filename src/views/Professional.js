					<div className='mb-3'>David received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in physics from Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, and from the University of Colorado, respectively.</div>
					<div className='mb-3'>
						David helped develop the atomic-clock timekeeping system for the US and for the world, while working for the National Bureau of Standards (later renamed the National Institute of Standards
						and Technology — NIST) with the responsibility to generate official time for the United States. “This People” magazine said, “Timex has nothing up on David W Allan, who’s perhaps the
						world’s more sophisticated time-keeper. But now, his timely scientific methods have led him to what may prove one of the more exciting discoveries in recent times – a new planet.”

					<div className='mb-3'>
						Atomic clocks are the most accurate time pieces in the world. Over the years, the US atomic clock team has developed the most accurate clocks with astounding precisions and accuracies of
						much better than a billionth of a second in a day.
					</div>
					<div className='mb-3'>
						The benefits of high precision timing are way beyond most anyone’s comprehension. GPS would not work; telecommunications would not work, which includes telephones and cell phones.
						Computers would not work, which includes i-phones, i-pads and essentially all digital electronic devices.
					</div>
					<div className='mb-3'>
						Distribution of electric power depends upon it. Airplane and ship navigation depend upon it. Even the check-out stand laser scanner at your grocery store uses precision timing. All modern
						cars would not run without the precision timing devices that are now built into them. The stock market and banking transactions use precision timing at the millionth of a second level and
						are looking for better synchronization techniques.
					</div>
					<div className='mb-3'>
						New robotic cars which are now operative, are critically dependent on precision space and time measurements, and they have a perfect accident report. And the benefits list goes on, which
						includes all the high tech, satellites, and space exploration fields in astronomy and otherwise. These kinds of clocks are backbone to the internet.
					</div>
					<div className='mb-3'>
						The above uses are for the civilian sector of our population. Precision timing is totally integrated into our military and security systems. If you did away with precision timing, you
						would be back in the dark ages. It is, technologically, the backbone of our high tech society.

						After retirement from the Boulder labs, he helped Hewlett Packard develop a method for synchronizing cell towers around the world. The also asked him to write a definitive article on the
						“Science of Timekeeping” for the lay audience.
