					We are on a satellite called EARTH traveling in our galaxy – fulfilling the divine purposes of the Lord –providing immortality for each of His children and eternal life to those choosing to
					follow His perfect plan of happiness. This is His work and His glory – to bring the pass our immortality and offering eternal lifes to as many as will hearken to the voice of His Beloved
					Son, whose all-encompassing atonement is a direct manifestation of God’s infinite love (John 3:16) for His precious sons and daughters.

					The earth was created for this purpose — nigh unto Kolob near the center of our galaxy and was launched on its divine trajectory going from the presence of the Lord to its Garden of Eden
					state. After the Fall, it moved into our current telestial state, where we are about two-thirds of the way out from the center of our galaxy. Now, we are close to moving from our telestial
					state into a new heaven and a new earth into a terrestrial state (the millennial epoch where Christ will reign as King of kings and Lord of lords).
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In this glorious millennial state, where He will wipe away all tears and pain, there will be no need for the sun. Christ will be our light. The millennial epoch is for Him to prepare the
					earth to be delivered to the Father – back into celestial realms – completing one eternal round. We see the grand chiasmus of the plan: CELESTIAL to TERRESTRIAL to TELESTIAL to TERRESTRIAL
					to CELESTIAL – one eternal round.

					Here in mortality (this telestial sphere of existence) we are limited by the four dimensions of time and space. God and angels are not. Motivated by pure love they operate in the fifth
					dimension, which we call the eternity domain. “Time only is measured unto man.” (Alma 30:8) God’s time is not limited as ours and is very different from man’s. God’s time is the process of
					bringing about His eternal purposes for His children, whom He loves with an infinite love. Our worth in His eyes is beyond our comprehension. (To learn more of this, see chapters 21-25 of my
					book

					It is exciting to think that we are near the end of all telestial activity – typically called the end of the world. But for the true followers of Christ, we are near the beginning of the
					glorious millennial epoch. We are privileged to live in the most exciting time in the history of the earth. All the prophets looked forward to our day. (D&C 121:26-32) As the world spirals
					down, Christ’s followers spiral up. We know who will win this war now being waged against humanity by him who knows it is his last hour. Satan is doing everything he can to turn people from
					Christ, because he knows Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by Him. (John 14:6)

					The best thing we can do is to be Christ centered and to live and share this glorious message of His gospel. He has promised, and His promises are sure, that in this latter-day scenario, He
					“will gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, even as many as will hearken to my voice and humble themselves before me, and call upon me in mighty prayer.”
					(D&C 29:2) I pray that we may.
