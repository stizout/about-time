						<li>The hour is coming when all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God. (John 5:25)</li>
						<li>Story of Lazarus and the rich man: great gulf fixed (Luke 16:19-31)</li>

							Prison doors opened and the prisoners go free as they come to Christ. (1 Peter. 3:18-20; 4:6 – Doctrine & Covenants 138:22 )They that hear shall live. Live according to God in the

						<li>Three days earlier, He was laid in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathaea (his uncle) by Joseph and Nicodemus – wrapped in linen with spices.</li>
						<li>The Marys came to the empty tomb, saw the angels, the empty tomb, and heard the glorious announcement: “He is not here, He is risen.”</li>
						<li>Peter and John ran to the tomb and saw the clothes folded.</li>
						<li>Mary Magdalene lingered and was the first to see the risen Lord. When he said, “Mary,” her heart went from the deepest depths of despair to the heights of ecstasy.</li>
						<li>He then appears to Peter and two of the women.</li>
						<li>He walks with two disciples on the road to Emmaus.</li>
						<li>
							He then appears to the Apostles, and later to five hundred at once and ascends after proclaiming that they will take the gospel to the uttermost parts of the Earth. Angels proclaim, “As
							ye have seen him go… he shall come in like manner. This is the most important event in all the history of the Earth – overcoming physical and spiritual death. In Him alone can we and
							nations be free, and no man cometh unto the Father but by Him.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p className='my-3'>
						His atonement – completed by the resurrection (witnessed by large numbers at the time and by large numbers afterward – gives the greatest hope possible to all of Father’s children in the
						perfect plan of happiness. The gospel is not only the “good news,” it is the best news.

						<li>How can we tell the wonders of His ways and the magnitude of all that He has done for us?</li>
						<li>
							The Scriptures are replete in the telling. The more we ponder, pray, and study the importance of what He has done for us, the more we want to share it with rejoicing with the whole
							world.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p className='my-3'>
						The Easter Season is celebrated by Arab, Jew (unknowingly) and Christian (at nominally the same time), and all three celebrations point to the atonement. Thank you, Lord; we see Your
						loving hand everywhere.
