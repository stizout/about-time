					<li>Gives you energy</li>
					<li>Costs you a couple of dozen pennies per day</li>

					<li>Gives you all the omega-3 fatty acid that you need</li>
					<li>Makes a wide base nutrient contribution to your health</li>
					<li>Contributes to brain longevity and reduces the rate of aging</li>
					<p className='my-4'>And it is amazingly easy to use as it can be added to about anything</p>

					In March 2008, I would have thought so too. My wife and I reading news letters from Dr. Williams and Dr. Weil giving some of the above amazing properties of chia seed. The more we learned
					about chia, the more amazed we were. We soon learned that we were not alone; that this was new to almost everyone else.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We found a good bulk source in Southwest Arizona and made a four-day trip to bring back over 3,000 lbs. of chia – sight-unseen. We were able to get that for $3.00 per pound and shared that
					with family and friends. It was gone in a few weeks. Then the price went out of sight because lots of others had read the same newsletters, and the demand exceeded the supply. Now the market
					seems to be stabilizing. At the writing of this Book, you can get it from COSTCO for $15 for two pounds.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The reason for our general lack of knowledge about the health benefits of chia seed was that it had been one of the most important foods of the ancient American, but the Conquistadors,
					wanting to destroy them, destroyed their chia crops. Dr. Coates of the U. of AZ in 1991 reintroduced it back again. By the year 2000, western Australian farmers learned about it and have
					developed some of the best chia farms in the world. We have gotten ours from Australia, Mexico, and Bolivia.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The proof of the pudding is in the eating. My wife and I love to put our two tablespoons per day per person in a small glass of orange juice. We let it set for 15 minutes or so as it swells
					up almost 9:1 in a water-based substance, and it tastes great and is so easy. I have tried the experiment to let that be my main breakfast item as I did today before going on a mountain bike
					ride up on the deer trails above our home. I had plenty of energy, and really enjoyed the ride.

					Prior grinding up the chia seeds seems to aid assimilation. Where can you find a better food to solve the omega-3 deficiency problem, which is very severe in the American diet? It is the
					richest plant on the planet in omega-3. A quarter cup is equivalent to nearly a pound of wild salmon. We also enjoy supplementing our omeaga-3 with some wild caught salmon. To read about the
					seriousness of the Omega-3 deficiency problem in our diets read: http://ezinearticles.com/?Classic-Symptoms-of-Omega-3-Deficiency&id=490927 This is an informative article but misses the
					miracle of chia as a solution to the omega-3 deficiency problem – again probably like we were in 2008, when we didn’t know about chia.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Some of the diseases associated with omega-3 deficiency include Cancer, Arthritis, Obesity, Heart disease, Arteriosclerosis, and Diabetes. One can find lots of good information on the
					internet both on the omega-3 deficiency problem, as well as information about the nutrient benefits of chia. There are also lots of easy and good recipes for using chia available on the
					internet.
				</p>
				<p className='font-bold'>Other nutritional properties of chia seed are (by weight):</p>
				<ul
					role='list'
					className='marker:text-olive-600 list-disc pl-5 mb-4'
				>
					<li>15 times more magnesium than broccoli</li>
					<li>6 times more calcium than whole milk</li>
					<li>3 times more iron than spinach</li>
					<li>1 T will nutritionally sustain a person for a day; 2 T per day are recommended.</li>
					<li>35 lbs will feed 2 people for a year; that is 16 cents per day per person at our cost.</li>
					<li>Great for athletes because it prolongs hydration, is a tissue and muscle builder, & increases endurance.</li>
				</ul>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					According to tradition, Aztec Indians ran from village to village eating only from a small pouch of chia seed. The omega-3: omega-6 balance is ideal for human consumption. It also contains
					other very useful minerals: zinc, manganese, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, copper, and boron, which aids calcium assimilation. All of these minerals are also useful for good body
					chemistry.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We know of no side effects. It seems to be nearly the ideal food, but because of its mild flavor it is always fun to use it in conjunction with other tasty foods. It is so versatile that it
					can go in about any recipe. It is reported to have a long shelf life and we have now verified that. We highly recommend eating chia seeds after having used – and enjoyed – chia’s benefits
					for six years.
