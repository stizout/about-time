				<p className='font-bold my-5'>The Abundant Life, or Regeneration or Degeneration, Our Choice</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>From the Work of Dr. Khalsa – David W Allan: Commentary</p>
				<p className='font-bold mb-5'>INTRODUCTION</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>Historically, in many cultures, the aged among them were the sages – highly respected for their wisdom.</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In modern America, the aged are for the most part treated more and more as a burden, as ever increasing percentages of them suffer from old-age dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other
					age-related problems.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					What if most, if not all, of these age-related degenerative conditions could be reversed or avoided in the first place? Dr. Khalsa’s pioneering work shows that this prospect may well be the
					case as it relates to the mind. Dr. Andrew Weil, who has been referred to as America’s physician, says of Khalsa’s Book, Brain Longevity, “A must-read for everyone interested in defending
					themselves against age-related loss of memory and other mental functions.” How wonderful it would be to return the cultures of the world – especially the American culture – to the blessings
					of respect for the aged and for their wisdom. We could then claim the blessings of living the fifth of the Ten Commandments.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Dr. Khalsa’s enormously important work deals mainly with the brain – the flesh and blood house for our intelligence. He shows how you can improve “your mind and memory,” and how you can
					“regenerate your concentration, energy, and learning ability for a lifetime of peak mental performance.” He shows how you can regenerate from a degenerative mental condition.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We are three-part beings: intelligence, spirit, and body. The nurturing of all three parts leads to the full and abundant life, and is the pathway to eternal life – the greatest of all the
					promises and gifts of God. It is fascinating to me that the Lord has designed His perfect plan of happiness such that we can best nurture ourselves by nurturing others – to love our neighbor
					as ourselves. In so doing, we can help one another to overcome the false traditions that move us away from God. With a goal of seeking truth and light – bringing us ever closer to God – we
					overcome the degenerative challenges that oft’ times beset us.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					As we think deeply about it, we see that the degeneration (all kinds) that our societies suffer results mainly from false traditions.{' '}

					</a>
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					It is our opportunity to overcome these, and in so doing we grow. If we knew and lived the truth, then we could and would be free of degeneration. There is such a thing as dying – not of
					disease – but peacefully after finishing one’s mission in mortality.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					As we look forward to a millennial society, there will be those who will be raised with health and who will inculcate these truths into their very beings. They will continually grow in light
					and truth, and will avoid degeneration. There is no reason that we cannot move toward that kind of ideal society now.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In regard to the brain, there is a fascinating section in Roy Mills’ Book The Soul’s Remembrance where he describes what happens at birth as our pre-mortal intelligence gets, as it were,
					down-loaded into the mind.
					<a
						className='text-blue-600'

					</a>{' '}
					The amount that we bring with us for our mortal sojourn is enormous, and it makes wide-band computer systems look small.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					This transfer is done most efficiently and effectively as part of the birthing process. This intelligence mind integration perspective will come up again as we conclude this article. We will
					see that agency – our choices – make all the difference; hence, the reason for those words in the title. Next, I will go through some of the highlights of Khalsa’s Book. Then at the end of
					the article, we will pull together some of the other exciting dimensions of regeneration for all aspects of our beings. The hope here is to give some of the ways that will help us better
					move toward the ideal society we seek.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>BRAIN LONGEVITY</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>The Four Complementary Means Khalsa has found that there are four complementary means for improving “Your Mind and Memory” – regardless of what age you are at:</p>

				<ul
					role='list'
					className='marker:text-olive-600 list-disc pl-5'
				>
					<li>Nutritional therapy</li>
					<li>Stress management</li>
					<li>Exercise therapy</li>
					<li>Pharmacology</li>
				</ul>

				<p className='mb-3'>
					He has also unveiled a very important cause of mind and memory degeneration, and gives ways to avoid that cause. His claims have been clinically validated, and will help you to:
				</p>
				<ul
					role='list'
					className='marker:text-olive-600 list-disc pl-5'
				>
					<li>Think better</li>
					<li>Become more productive and optimistic</li>
					<li>Overcome age-associated memory loss</li>
					<li>Increase your brain’s strength and vitality</li>
				</ul>
				<p className='mb-3'>Meet the world with energy and joy.</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>We will review the highlights of each of the above means, and next we will see why stress management is so vitally important.</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>The Cortisol Connection and Statistical Trends</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					“Cortisol is one of the hormones secreted by the adrenal glands. It’s secreted in response to stress. In moderate amounts, cortisol is not harmful. But when produced in excess, day after day
					– as a result of chronic, unrelenting stress – this hormone is so toxic to the brain that it kills and injures brain cells by the billions.” Hence, we see the need for being at peace in the
					midst of the storms of life. Dr. Khalsa has unveiled that the secretion of excess cortisol is a major cause of memory-loss problems. He also believes that this “is one of the primary causes
					of Alzheimer’s disease. His four complementary means allow you to correct this very serious and wide-spread problem in our society.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>What an enormous blessing such a regeneration of the mind would provide for this country – as well as the world.</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					As Khalsa points out, “Wisdom comes naturally to older people. It is the natural product of experience. Your neurons are biologically built for wisdom. As the years of your life… unfold…,
					each of your neurons… sprout… new dendrites, and…[make] new dendritic connections with other neurons… Living long is the only way to achieve this abundance of multi-branched dendrites, with
					billions of connections.” Hence, we see that wisdom can come with age if we haven’t suffered serious degeneration — and if we have used our brains to process worthwhile information.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Otherwise, the current statistical trends are gloomy. Khalsa tells of an article by the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Institute on Aging, citing that now the government spends 50% of
					its tax dollars on the elderly and in ten years that is anticipated to grow to 75%. The article also said that “almost 50 percent of all people older than eighty-five have Alzheimer’s…”
					Khalsa says, “Over the next few decades, an unprecedented number of people will join the ranks of the elderly. Unless current trends in cognitive decline are reversed, this ‘graying of
					America’ will create a public health crisis.” Currently, there are 4 million persons with Alzheimer’s. This number is expected to increase to 10 million over the next 15 years. With the
					above trends, over 30 years, 20% of the population will be over 65 and about 90% of them will have Alzheimer’s.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Of this Khalsa says, “To me, that notion is absolutely horrifying. If it happens, it will be a social holocaust. In the Epilogue of his Book, Khalsa recoups, “…I do not believe [these
					trends] will [continue]. I believe that millions of us, working together, and working on our own, will reverse these trends… As we age, we will remain healthy. We will remain productive.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In the beginning of his Book, Khalsa optimistically says, “…I think [it] is very possible, Alzheimer’s will once again become a relatively rare disease. The people rescued from Alzheimer’s
					will also experience a very positive phenomenon. They won’t grow less intelligent as they age; they’ll just grow wiser. Their ever-increasing neuronal ‘branches’ will give them a rich,
					complex sense of understanding. Their vast experience will endow them with a deep, abiding comprehension of life. They will achieve the status all elderly people yearn for, that of valued
					elder adviser.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>How Does Stress Hurt You?</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Khalsa learned that “There are three essential ways that stress destroys optimal function of the brain, and blots out memory: “First, when cortisol is released in a stressful situation, it
					inhibits the utilization of blood sugar by the brain’s primary memory center, the hippocampus. If there isn’t enough blood sugar,… the brain has no way to chemically lay down a memory. A
					person can experience an event, but have almost no recall of it…
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Second, cortisol overproduction interferes with the function of the brain’s neurotransmitters. Thus, even if a memory has been properly laid down…, it can no longer be easily accessed. In
					effect, the ‘lines are down,’ just like downed telephone lines in a storm. Brain cells just can’t communicate with one another, and the mind becomes muddled. This truth is why cortisol is
					called the ‘concentration killer.’ It’s why people often become temporarily befuddled in high-stress situations.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Third, too much cortisol kills brain cells. This happens when cortisol disrupts normal brain cell metabolism, and causes excessive amounts of calcium to enter brain cells. This excess of
					calcium eventually produces molecules called free radicals, which kill brain cells from within. Over long periods, excess cortisol can kill billions of brain cells this way.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Dr. Khalsa initially learned this from Dr. Robert Sapolsky of Stanford University. Sapolsky had proven it for animals. Two biologists in Montreal proved that Sapolsky’s findings carried over
					to humans, and Dr. Alfred Kazniak of the University of Arizona “showed that stress levels in elderly people correlated directly with their levels of memory loss.” Subsequently, Khalsa –
					using his stress-management program – has achieved “unparalleled clinical success” with a significant number of human beings.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					He is now recognized as a major pioneer in the field of Brain Longevity. His Book is the best that I am aware of in this regard. His work – along with others like his – could change the
					world for good in a major way – showing the way to achieve brain regeneration and to the avoidance of brain degeneration.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Once Dr. Khalsa learned this vital connection of the effects of cortisol on brain degeneration, he began “to develop a full-scale protocol for brain longevity; he with intensity said, “I
					threw myself into this task heart and soul, and found it the most rewarding and exciting work of my life. “For months I focused the entirety of my intellect and spirit on this challenge. I
					pored through volumes of medical textBooks. I consulted with a number of researchers. I began following the latest trends in memory research and neurogeriatrics.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					I also intensified my study of complementary medicine, because I was convinced that Eastern medicine, with its emphasis on the integration of mind and body, offered special therapeutic
					insights… “…Because my pilgrimage into the world of brain aging was motivated by the desire to help others, and because it consumed every fiber of my intellect and emotions, it became, quite
					literally, a spiritual experience…”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					He subsequently, to this massive research effort, has validated his findings clinically and has had great success – now with a large number of patients, who were previously suffering from
					brain degeneration, dementia, Alzheimer’s, and the like. Ever since Dr. Marion Diamond of UC Berkeley showed, in her pioneering work, that you can grow the brain at any age, there followed
					hundreds of papers and supportive research that has given both great insights into how the brain works, but also great hope for brain regeneration at any age. In particular, her work is
					inspiring as it relates to the marvelous growth the brain may achieve at early ages in a properly stimulating environment – wholesome music, for example. Dr. Khalsa has provided a clinical
					way to achieve this regeneration to both grow the brain and repair and/or replace damaged or dead brain cells.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In regard to stress, Dr. Khalsa offers some techniques, as part of his stress-management program, that allow you to live in a stressful environment, but be at peace. These techniques, I
					believe, are very valuable – plus, they cost you nothing. They are techniques that you can learn and implement with great benefit to your Brain Longevity. Below, I will review some of these.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>THE FOUR COMPLEMENTARY MEANS FOR BRAIN REGENERATION</p>
				<p className='mb-3 italic'>(1) Nutritional Therapy and Brain Regeneration</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					“What’s good for the heart is good for the head,” says Khalsa. This is the single most important dietary rule for brain longevity. “The brain is critically dependent upon abundant blood
					flow, because it requires about 25 percent of all blood pumped by the heart. Therefore, any disruption of cerebral circulation has a profoundly negative effect upon the brain.” The
					traditional American diet is the killer – causing us to lead the world in arteriosclerosis-related diseases and other indulgent diseases, which include heart attacks and heart disease,
					strokes, diabetes, arthritis, kidney and liver diseases, osteoporosis, the big “C” (cancer), and others.Khalsa says, “…vascular plaque caused by excessive fat contributes to decreased blood
					flow to brain cells.” This is a common malady coming from the typical American diet.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					When you consider that the brain is only about 2% of our body weight, then this implies that our central processing unit (CPU = our brain) gets more than 12 times as much blood per unit mass
					and time than the rest of the body – on average. Clearly, clean, healthy blood is critical to the brain. “I recommend a diet that revolves around whole grains, vegetables, non-animal
					protein, fruits, and an occasional serving of fish,” counsels Dr. Khalsa. In addition, he recommends antioxidant vitamins and minerals. These include vitamins A, B-complex, C, E,
					choline-rich lecithin, trace minerals that include magnesium, coenzyme Q-10. He says that type A personalities are prone to magnesium depletion.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					“Antioxidants are crucial,” he says, “because they can protect neurons… [Free] radical molecules… kill neurons… Antioxidants are… ‘free radical scavengers.’ Other free radical scavengers
					include… selenium, zinc, and chromium.” Other natural medical tonics and herbs that he recommends are: Ginkgo biloba, Asian ginseng, phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl choline, and
					acetyl-L-carnitine. In addition, wheat-grass juice, bluegreen algae, and spirulina “are the richest possible sources of partial proteins called peptides, which the brain converts to
					neuropeptides… Many of these natural medicinal tonics have dramatic effects upon cognitive function…”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Also, most Americans run around dehydrated and don’t know it, as shown by Dr. Batmanghelidj and as described in Section 7.4 of Chapter 7. For the brain as well as the body, Dr. B. has
					documented the extreme importance of drinking enough water. It is very encouraging as Dr. Khalsa goes on to say that “relatively simple nutritional changes can have a profound effect upon
					the brain.” Proper choices can help provide healing (regeneration) and/or help provide prevention against those diseases mentioned above.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 italic'>(2) Stress Management and Brain Regeneration</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Because of the seriousness of excessive stress being the indirect cause of the death of billions of neurons, we have two remedial actions we can take: Avoid or remove as much stress as we
					can, and Learn how to keep unavoidable stressors from inducing stress in our lives. Stress can move us into a deadly spiral. In other words, being stressed can lead us into a mental state
					where it is harder to deal with stress. In so doing, large scale amounts of neurons are being killed, and we become anxious about our declining mental abilities. This anxiety leads to more
					stress. A large number of people are dying in America due to this deadly spiral. The wonderful message of Dr. Khalsa’s Book is that this is totally avoidable. When stressors occur, we don’t
					need to be stressed. I am reminded of the scripture, “Perfect love casteth out all fear.”(1 John 4:18) There is the profound cryptic phrase, “Attitude determines altitude!” We can move into
					the depths of despair, anxiety, fear, and irrationality, or we can move to the heights of hope, love, peace, and rational thinking. I was delighted to read that Dr. Khalsa has witnessed in
					his patients the great power of prayer in moving us to these heights.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					God is always there for us, and Khalsa points out that a social support structure (family and friends) is very important also. “In one interesting experiment, monkeys were subjected to a
					flashing light, followed by an electric shock. Soon they began to react to the flashing light with a copious secretion of cortisol. If a monkey had one companion, however, the cortisol
					secretion was markedly lower. And if a monkey had five companions, no cortisol secretion at all occurred.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					God opens the door for peace in the midst of turmoil, conflict and even war. “My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you…” (John 14:27) The inner peace that comes
					from Him is the ideal stress suppressor. Stress is not, of itself, necessarily bad. Stress is integral to God’s design of our bodies – to deal with danger, etc. It is the constant diet of
					stress that is so destructive to our brains, to our immune systems and to our lives. The peace the Lord gives as we come unto Him, gives us balance and perspective.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We are given His perspective as we ask, seek and knock (Matt. 7:7) to find His will in our lives. This world with its demands upon us leads to excess stress – almost always asking more of us
					than we can give. In contrast, the Lord will never ask more of us than we can do. This is why Matt. 7:7 becomes so vitally important in our lives. As we seek to do His will, we find the
					peace we seek and can move the path of love and service, and doors open that we never dreamed possible.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We also get answers as we ask to know of His truths that will help us to understand our purpose in life and how we can best serve Him by serving others. As we unconditionally give ourselves
					to Him, He can do so much more with our lives than we, by our own devices, ever could. As we do His will, we will find not only the greatest joy, but the abundant life as well and without
					the stresses of the world.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 italic'>(3) Exercise Therapy and Brain Regeneration</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>Physical Exercise and the Brain</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Dr. Khalsa says that, “Aerobic exercise has direct beneficial effects upon the brain and endocrine system. It increases blood flow to the brain, and even spurs growth of new brain cell
					‘branches.’ …protects the body against the stress response, and also ‘burns off’ harmful stress hormones. “…it causes the release of various neurological and endocrinological secretions,
					including norepinephrine, the stimulating brain chemical that acts as a neurotransmitter. Norepinephrine is one of the most important neurotransmitters in the laying down of new memories,
					and is especially important in moving memories from short-term to long-term storage. Norepinephrine is also extremely important in the maintenance of a good mood.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					“…exercise is unequivocally effective at dispelling depression… [it] is also an effective buffer against stress… For approximately four hours following exercise, people experience a
					‘tranquilizer effect’ that diminishes their physical responses to stress…
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Too little exercise (less than half an hour) doesn’t effectively evoke the tranquilizer effect.” On the other hand, “…it’s a mistake to exercise too strenuously. …researcher’s frequency
					theorize that strenuous exercise actually increases formation of free radical cells, through ‘oxygen toxicity.’”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Dr. Andrew Weil, in his excellent Book Spontaneous Healing, recommends that walking be the primary form of exercise. It takes a little longer to get the same aerobic benefit than some other
					forms, but it has the very desirable advantage that you can walk and talk with someone else – making it very enjoyable. Making the exercise experience pleasant also contributes to wellbeing
					and stress management.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					There are five ways for the body to get rid of poisons. Exercising enhances the excretion of these poisons in a major way. If we are eating properly, exercising adequately, breathing deeply
					(clean air), and drinking sufficient water, then we will have frequent healthy bowel movements, our urine will be clear, our lungs will be clear, and we will be working up a sweat daily.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Getting rid of these poisons is critical to our health – including the optimum functioning of our brains. We can see that the excretion of these poisons is supported in principal ways by the
					respiratory system, the circulatory system, the lymphatic system, the digestive system and in harmony with all other systems of the body. When these are all working well, we are well. In
					this regard, one form of exercise that often gets missed is that to stimulate a healthy lymphatic system. It has been shown that up and down motion provides a pumping action on the lymphatic
					system, as would occur in jogging, in a good walking rate, or on a rebounder (mini-trampoline).
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>Meditation Exercise and the Brain</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					One of Dr. Khalsa’s fortes is mind/body exercise. He says, “Even more effective than standard aerobicexercise …is [the] use of a series of yogic mind/body exercises… My clinical experience
					strongly indicates that these unique mind/body exercises increase mental fitness… [They] restore the brain’s biochemical ability to lay down new memories, and to focus intensely for extended
					periods. They also stimulate access to existing ‘remote’ memories of long-past events.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					He recommends four to five mind/body exercises out of more than 2000 that he examined. These are specifically designed to enhance brain power. They “drive nutrient-rich blood to the brain
					and to particular endocrine glands. These exercises create an immediate surge of mental energy, increasing concentration, short-term memory, and learning ability… Aftereffects of this burst
					of energy can last up to twenty-four hours. Because of this prolonged effect, I recommend some of these exercises as part of a daily wake-up routine.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Personally, I love these mind/body exercises,… I receive a profound sense of rejuvenation from them.” He says that they are important contributors to both his physical and spiritual
					well-being.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Dr. Khalsa’s mediation exercises were so successful that he offered a course for doctors getting ready to take their board exams. He says, “I showed all of them how to meditate, and how to
					apply the mental training techniques of peak performance. …the doctors taking my course had over a 90-percent pass rate, compared to the national average of about 50-percent..”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>His guidelines for how to meditate are very simple:</p>
				<ul
					role='list'
					className='marker:text-olive-600 list-disc pl-5'
				>
					<li>Find a quiet place with no distractions</li>
					<li>Allow 10 to 20 minutes; don’t use an alarm</li>
					<li>Sit comfortably and relax all of your muscles from bottom of toes to the top of your head</li>
					<li>Stop all internal dialog and mind chatter</li>
					<li>
						To help you stop thinking and calm down, silently repeat a pleasant word or phrase – like“peace” or “love” or one that has religious or calming significance; Don’t be concerned if thoughts
						intrude; inhale and bring yourself back, relax, and meditate
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p className='mb-3'>When you finish, sit quietly for a minute or two, and try to merge your calm state of mind with your normal outlook.</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					“That’s all there is to it. If it sounds simple, that’s because it is.” These are his simplest set of guidelines for meditation. His “naad Yoga” program is more complicated, but it
					apparently is much more effective. Even so, it is not that difficult either. He also describes some advanced meditation forms in his Book. He says that the value of meditation “is that it
					allows you to experience a continuous flow of energy. This peaceful flow happens because your mind becomes very still. It is a quick way to achieve a profound state of deep relaxation and
					stress relief.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					“Other physical effects of meditation are decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate… …meditation also causes a decline in cortisol production. This decline usually
					persists long after the period of meditation ends. Furthermore, among people who meditate regularly, cortisol levels tend to remain low, day after day. “This medley of physical effects
					caused by meditation creates lifelong health advantages. Meditation has been shown to slow the aging process significantly, and to increase not just lifespan but ‘health span.’” “…meditation
					can… …significantly heighten learning ability and creative problem-solving.” As one moves into the “Theta brain-wave” state, “deep personal insights,… creative ideas, and [an adeptness] at
					creative problem-solving” often occur. “Theta brain waves combine a pleasant, relaxed feeling with extreme alertness.” With practice, people can move themselves into the theta, brain-wave
					state at will.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>Exercising the Brain as a Muscle</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In the pioneering work of Dr. Marian Diamond of UC Berkeley, she was able to show that one can actually grow the brain at any age. It is much like a muscle; use it or lose it. In her famous
					Book Magic Trees of the Mind, she discusses how that growth process can be augmented. For a very brief{' '}
					<a
						className='text-blue-600'
						href='http://www.allanstime.com/Spiritual/BookReports/magic_trees.htm'
						target='_blank'
					>
						report
					</a>
					. Dr. Diamond discusses the seven different areas of brain development and how they can complement each other. When they do, then brain growth is significantly enhanced. These areas are: 1)
					language, 2) math and logic, 3) spacial representation, 4) music, 5) physical skills, 6) interpersonal and intra-personal skills, and 7) knowledge of nature. We have, for example, all heard
					of the Mozart effect – how listening to Mozart helps us retain and learn about the material we are studying. The best dendrite growth occurs when the environment is pleasant and positive.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Following up on Dr. Diamond’s work, Dr. Khalsa recommends “at least a couple of hours each day doing some form of mental exercise.” This procedure is especially valuable for older people. He
					says that, “Studies have shown that when people do engage in moderate pleasant forms of mental exercise, it increases not just their knowledge, but also the efficiency and power of their
					brains.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>Prayer – a Fundamental Brain Exercise</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We have been doing some very exciting physics on how prayer works. The coupling mechanism between you and God are called diallel-field lines and the description desired is written up, in
					part, at the following{' '}
					<a
						className='text-blue-600'
						href='http://www.allanstime.com/Spiritual/In_Touch_with_Eternity.htm'
						target='_blank'
					>
						link
					</a>
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					I was so happy to read of Dr. Khalsa’s great support of the power of prayer. He has a whole section on The Healing Science of Prayer. He points out some excellent documented sources of the
					power of prayer in healing and in moving one into a healthy meditative state. He prays for his patients, and believes that health care is just that – truly caring for his patients.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					He discusses four kinds of prayers: (1) colloquial conversation with God; (2) petitioning God; (3) ritualistic prayers (employing a prepared script); and (4) meditative prayer. He says that
					all four can “elicit the meditative state, and the relaxation response.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					“It appears, however, as if the formal meditative prayer – which involves listening to God more than talking to Him – is the most effective style of prayer for creating a subjective
					perception of closeness to God. Survey respondents were twice as likely to feel a ‘strong relationship with God’ if they used the meditative style… The style that least elicited a subjective
					sense of connection to God was the petitionary style.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					I derive a significant level of peace and enjoyment by early morning meditation, prayer, and study of the scriptures. I find that when I am in the low-frequency meditative states when I am
					waking – which is usually around 5:00 a.m. for me – I receive some of my most profound insights and creative thoughts. This coupled with the beautiful colors associated with the sunrise –
					refracting through the clouds with spectrum of red hues and reflecting off of snow covered Mount Nebo in shades of pink – is a inspirational sight to behold.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In addition, an extremely useful morning ritual for me has been to exercise while listening to the scriptures in French. This pulls together inspirational material with the language
					development area of the brain. I include in these Dr. Batmanghelidj’s recommended back exercises, as I am dealing with an old back injury. I also jump on a rebounder. Plus, I drink my 8+
					glasses of water each day – away from meals as much as practicable. The amount you need to drink depends, of course, on body weight, etc., and the 8+ is good for me at my current 170 pounds,
					The “+” indicates what is needed to make sure you replace what you sweat away and to make sure the urine is clear. To get up a sweat, I like to mountain bike in our local mountains
					(beautiful scenery), cross-country ski, or walk with Edna. These routines have provided great benefit to me mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually.

				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>(4) Pharmacology and Brain Regeneration</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Dr. Khalsa discusses how the brain works, and then why he recommends certain pharmaceuticals to act –as it were – as rebuilding agents or nutrients for the brain. These include natural
					herbal remedies as well and which, fortunately, have little or no side effects. Let us remember that it has been documented that the body can generate some of these, naturally, especially
					during a healthy state of meditation and otherwise at times – especially if we have a proper diet – avoiding the toxicity of the typical “American diet.” and moving to organic-nutritional
					foods that nourish the brain as well as the body.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Dr. Khalsa provides “a list of the most appropriate natural medicinal tonics for brain longevity, with general dosages.” He also describes the benefits of each. Clearly, different folks have
					different needs, and each should follow his or her own heart after studying these out as to what may be appropriate. And, if you feel the need, discuss your feelings with your health-care
					specialist.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>NATURAL MEDICAL TONIC DAILY DOSAGE</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>Gingko biloba 60-320 mg</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>Phosphatidyl choline (from lecithin) 1.5-10 g</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>Chlorophyll based green juice products one serving</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>Coenzyme Q-10 100 mg</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>Ginseng (moderates cortisol) 0.75-1.5 g</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>Green tea 1-2 servings</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>DMAE (helps produce acetylcholine) 50-100 mg</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>Ching Chun Bao 4-8 tablets</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>Phosphatidyl serine (intelligence tests) 100-300 mg</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>Acetyl L-carnitine (aid right-left connect) 0.25-1.5 g</p>

				<p className='mb-5'>(Note: 1,000 mg = 1 g)</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					As he shows in his Book, “…brain function can be powerfully affected by nutritional therapy.” He often uses dosages recommended by the Europeans, because they are much freer than is America
					in using natural remedies. He points out the mistake that is being made in our society wherein “Caffeine… is the most widely used cognitive-enhancement product” with many long-term damaging
					effects. He further points out that in small amounts (100 mg or less per day), it is probably harmless.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Specifically, Khalsa says that in regard to the Green Juice Products, some of the common ones are: bluegreen algae, wheatgrass, barley grass, oat grass, spirulina, chlorella, and dulse.
					These products are “rich in the nine essential amino acids that cannot be manufactured by the body… …two of these – tryptophan and phenylalanine – are the primary ‘building blocks’ for the
					important neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In regard to the pharmaceuticals, he says, “Drugs that have contributed to some my patients’ most remarkable recoveries include deprenyl, piracetam, Hydergine,… pregnenolone, and DHEA “One
					of the drugs that has proven to be of particular benefit in cognitive enhancement, and in slowing progression of Alzheimer’s, is Deprenyl… …it is virtually free of side effects,… Deprenyl
					has the ability to ‘rescue damaged neurons before those neurons die.”
				</p>

				<p className='mb-3'>
					“Piracetam is… not… approved by the FDA. It is, however, widely prescribed in Europe… Piracetam, which has no known toxicity, has the unique and fascinating ability to enhance function of
					the brain’s corpus sallosum, the band of nerve fibers that coordinates the brain’s left and right hemispheres. [It] is thus considered valuable in the stimulation of creativity…” As an
					interesting aside, the “Holosync” program makes the same claim without chemicals. “Lucidril,” Khalsa says, “is a powerful free-radical scavenger that enjoys a reputation as an
					intelligencebooster..”– with a “demonstrated effect of increasing learning ability… Lucidril, like deprenyl, has been shown… to increase the life spans of animals by an average of 30
					percent.”
				</p>

				<p className='mb-3'>
					Khalsa uses Hydergine at the European dosage of 9 mg daily for “stabilizing the brain’s glucose metabolism; therefore it helps protect against the glucose disruption caused by cortisol
					production. Because of this effect on glucose metabolism, it enhances concentration as well as memory. He said, “I believe that a great deal of good can come from proper use of pharmacology…
				</p>

				<p className='mb-3'>
					To me, though, one of the most impressive things about my brain longevity programs is that they do not rely extensively upon the use of pharmaceutical drugs. Instead, I try to stimulate the
					patient’s body to heal itself.” In due process, he desires to “prescribe fewer drugs, in lower dosages, as [his] patients’ bodies and minds regain their former powers.”
				</p>

				<p className='mb-3'>
					DHEA, which is naturally generated by the body, “exists in… inverse proportion to cortisol. DHEA… is one of the most accurate biomarkers of aging, because production of it decreases
					regularly during each year of life. …at eighty, people commonly produce only 10 to 20 percent [as much as] they produced during their twenties. Furthermore, serum DHEA levels in Alzheimer’s
					patients are almost always far lower than those of the general population [at the same age]. Because the brain and endocrine system need DHEA for optimal function, even slightly lowered
					levels of DHEA can result in decreased ability to concentrate, and in diminished sex drive.”
				</p>

				<p className='mb-3'>
					Again, as an interesting aside, the “Holosync” program reports significant increases in DHEA production in studies made on users of their program. Here again, no chemicals are involved. I
					wonder, though I have not seen any data to validate it, if Dr. Khalsa’s “naad Yoga” approach generates a lot of the same frequencies as the “Holosync” program, as you chant with your own
					voice. If that were the case, then you may be able to generate a lot of the needed neuro-nutrients within your own body without the audio tapes. Both Dr. Khalsa’s clinic and the Holosync
					program have achieved internationally recognized success.
				</p>

				<p className='mb-3'>
					In regard to the Mozart effect, it is used as follows: to improve the health of families and communities; to improve memory, awareness, and the integration of learning styles; to improve
					listening and attention deficit disorders; for mental and physical disorders and injuries; and for imagery and visualization, to activate creativity, and reduce depression and anxiety. In
					contrast, “hard rock music” has been demonstrated to be destructive to the brain’s effectiveness.
				</p>

				<p className='mb-3'>
					Don Campbell in Boulder, CO, is the leading expert in the utilization of the Mozart effect. In their research, they pragmatically observe the effects of Mozart’s beautiful music coupling to
					our brains and biological systems in healthy ways, but the fundamental reason as to why the effect works as it does seems not to be known. The thought occurs to me that as the spiritual DNA
					associated with our intelligence couples and integrates itself into the physical (flesh and blood) brain, there are certain resonant relationships inherent therein. In the UFT with which we
					are working, we see that the brain is a beautiful example of diallel-line coupling between the spiritual and physical dimensions of our beings. Generally, the UFT predicts resonant
					conditions within the diallel structure, and we have observed such, in specific research experiments.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					From this perspective, whether one uses beautiful music, meditation, chanting, “naad Yoga,” “Holosync” audio frequencies, etc., each of them can have similar healthful effects upon the
					resonant frequency sensitivities of this marvelous-miraculous structure we call the brain.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Khalsa’s Book is also available from Time Warner AudioBooks in audio cassette format. My wife and I have listened to it, and it is outstanding. Hearing the audio for the useful voice
					frequencies augments the Book’s message greatly. There is another interesting and useful Book in regard to the health of the brain by Jean Carper, Your Miracle Brain. I highly recommend it
					as well.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>CONCLUSION</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Clearly, the abundant life has as its basic ingredients a healthy body, mind and spirit. In the computer community, there is a phrase, “Garbage in; garbage out!” As is true with computers,
					it seems to be the same with our bodies, our minds, and our spirits. Don’t feed them “garbage.” All three dimensions of our beings need to be nourished properly for balance and the abundant
					life. Yet there is much more. One of the big ironies taught by Christ is that as you seek first the Kingdom of God, then all else comes into balance. If you seek first after the things of
					this world, then you get badly out of balance. For example, if you focus just on body and/or mind health in priority over spiritual health, then you get out of balance.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We lived in Boulder, Colorado, for 32 years, and there folks often focus, as their top priority, on the health of their bodies. Eastern religions often focus on meditation and the mind. For
					me, the Christian way provides the opportunity for balance in all three dimensions of our beings and leads to the abundant life and perfect balance. So we have this interesting irony, as we
					“lose” our lives for the sake of the work of the Lord; then we “find” our lives at peace with Him and fulfilled to the fullest extent – body, mind and spirit. Then, we are “free indeed.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Our body, mind, and spirit work together in perfect concert as we give ourselves to Christ. We serve Him best when we serve and love one another. The proper nourishment of body, mind, and
					spirit is a means to a much greater end. It is now our choice. Will we love and serve and nourish – following the path of light and truth, and seek to fulfill our missions before Him? In so
					doing we generate and regenerate goodness in the bodies, minds, and spirits of ourselves as well as all those whom we are privileged to serve.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Choosing otherwise inhibits our progression, and can cause us to degenerate, as society is generally doing in body, mind and spirit. Some may argue that we are now living longer. I have a
					great concern about the quality of life for the ever increasing number who are suffering from dementia, old-age related problems, Alzheimer’s, etc.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The current trends are not healthy. Also, in that process we will find that peace that we seek that comes from being cleansed by Him. True faith and repentance is the Lord’s way of helping
					us to deal with the stressors in our lives – to bring about the calm and peace that comes only from Him as we truly repent. These stressors may include our mistakes and sins, the trials we
					face, the oppositions that appear to impede our progress. Remarkably, that repentance process removes all resentments. Holding resentments is poison to our souls

					. We see His divine purposes and the reason for all that has happened and is happening in our lives. This healing from resentment can and will bring great peace and calm in the midst of the
					storms of life.
