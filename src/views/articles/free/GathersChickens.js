					JST Luke 13:34 This he spake, signifying of his death. And in this very hour he began to weep over Jerusalem. 35 Saying, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou who killest the prophets, and stonest
					them who are sent unto thee; <span className='font-bold italic'>how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen her brood under her wings, and ye would not.</span> 36 Behold,
					your house is left unto you desolate. And verily I say unto you, Ye shall not know me, until ye have received from the hand of the Lord a just recompense for all your sins; until the time
					come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

					3 NEPHI 10:3 And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the people, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying: 4 O ye people of these great cities which have

					DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS 10:63 And this I do that I may establish my gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to contention concerning

					67 Behold, this is my doctrine— whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me, the same is my church. 68 Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me;

					prevail against them. 70 And now, remember the words of him who is the life and light of the world, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Amen.
