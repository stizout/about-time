				<p className='text-lg font-bold'>The Body’s Divine Design to be Healthy</p>
				<p className='italic mb-6'>David W Allan</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					If you are afraid of Ebola and coming pandemics, then the information here can help move you out of fear and into hope. Intelligent Design in the DNA has been well documented (Stephen C.
					Meyer Signature in the Cell) and extrapolates to the remarkable Divine Design of our bodies to self-heal. Being aware of both healing modalities and how to resist disease is key.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Dr. Lissa Rankin, as explained in more detail in Chapter 10 of the book, shares four extremely important dimensions to healing in her book, Mind Over Medicine. 1) The stress-response turns
					off the body’s immunity system from working properly; whereas, the relaxation-response turns it on. Fear and worry turn on the stress-response, which is exactly what you don’t want. I’ll
					share with you what she suggests to turn on the relaxation-response. 2) Healing and being resistant to disease occur best in a loving environment. A loving-caring health practitioner can
					make an enormous difference in the healing process. And 3) the body knows how to heal itself; if you move into a quiet space – meditating and asking – your inner pilot light, as she calls it
					— will help you to know what you need to do to be healed in body, mind, and spirit – revealing that to your heart and mind. And 4) there are many Anti-viral natural remedies that seem to be
					suppressed by the mainstream of society.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>On pages 147-9 of her book she shares:</p>
				<p className='mb-1 font-bold'>HOW TO ELICIT THE RELAXATION RESPONSE</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>(from Herbert Benson’s The Relaxation Response)</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>
					1. Pick a focus word, short phrase that is firmly rooted in your belief system, such as “one,” “peace,” “The Lord is my shepherd,” “Hail Mary, full of grace,” “Shalom,” or “Om.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>2. Sit quietly in a comfortable position.</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>3. Close your eyes.</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>4. Relax your muscles, progressing from your feet to your calves, thighs, abdomen, shoulders, head, and neck.</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>5. Breathe slowly and naturally, and as you do, say your focus word, sound, phrase, or prayer silently to yourself as you exhale.</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>
					6. Assume a passive attitude. Don’t worry about how well you’re doing. When other thoughts come to mind, simply say to yourself, “oh, well,” and gently return to your repetition.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>7. Continue for 10 to 20 minutes. [Don’t time yourself; let this time be according to your feelings.]</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>
					8. Do not stand immediately. Continue sitting quietly for a minute or so, allowing other thoughts to return. Then open your eyes and sit for another minute before rising.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>9. Practice the technique once or twice daily. Good times to do so are before breakfast and before dinner.</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					You will find these guidelines very similar to those of Dr. Khalsa as shared on page 223 of Chapter 13 of the book. Dr. Khalsa shares, “Cortisol is one of the hormones secreted by the
					adrenal glands. It’s secreted in response to stress. In moderate amounts, cortisol is not harmful. But when produced in excess, day after day – as a result of chronic, unrelenting stress –
					this hormone is so toxic to the brain that it kills and injures brain cells by the billions.” Hence, we see the need for being at peace in the midst of the storms of life. Dr. Khalsa has
					unveiled that the secretion of excess cortisol is a major cause of memory-loss problems. This is explained in the my article “4 Simple Secrets For Living to be 100.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					He also believes that this “is one of the primary causes of Alzheimer’s disease. His four complementary means, as outlined in the article “ allow you to correct this very serious and
					wide-spread problem in our society. Dr. Rankin goes on to share “A SIMPLIFIED WAY TO ELICIT THE RELAXATION RESPONSE:”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 ml-3'>Repetition of a word, sound, phrase, prayer, or muscular activity.</p>
				<p className='mb-3 ml-3'> Passively disregarding everyday thoughts that inevitably come to mind and return to your repetition.</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					“This can be done while exercising, making art, cooking, shopping, driving … whatever.” We live in a high-tech, high-stress world. These techniques are extremely valuable. As mentioned in
					the book, Dr. Khalsa shares that continual high-stress causes the body to release excess cortisol, which can kill millions of neurons in the brain each day. This seems to be one of the main
					causes of dementia as well. We can counter that neuron death rate by growing the brain as is also shared in Chapter 13.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>Dr. Rankin goes on to say:</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					All forms of meditation, to some degree, activate the parasympathetic nervous system, decrease stress-related cortisol, reduce respiration and heart rate, reduce the metabolic rate, increase
					blood flow in the brain, increase activity in the left prefrontal cortex (which is observed in happier people), strengthen the immune system, and lead to a state of relaxation.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Meditation also reduces pain, work stress, anxiety, and depression, promotes cardiovascular health, improves cognitive function, lowers blood pressure, reduces alcohol abuse, improves
					longevity, promotes healthy weight, reduces tension headaches, relieves asthma, controls blood sugar in diabetic patients, alleviates PMS, reduces chronic pain, improves immune function, and
					raises quality of life.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>Both Dr. Rankin’s work along with Dr. Bruce Lipton’s ground-breaking work are highlighted in Chapter 11.</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Dr. Lipton in his book Biology of Belief shares that the environment of the cell makes the most difference. Experimentally, he has demonstrated that traditional biology based on genetics
					leaves out this very important dimension of cell environment. The best environment comes with a healthy body, mind, and spirit. You can see that his work complements Dr. Rankin’s work, and,
					in fact, proceeded it. What we believe can make an enormous difference. I am reminded of the Savior’s parable that “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed … nothing shall be impossible
					unto you.” (Mathew 17:20)
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>Protect Yourself During a Pandemic</p>
				<p className='mb-3 italic'>
					Dr. David Williams’s recent issue of his newsletter Alternatives; For the Health Conscious Individual (Volume 17, No. 9. September 2014) is entitled “Protect Yourself During a Pandemic.”
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					He gives some practical things you can do to strengthen your immunity system. We have taken his newsletter for years and have confidence in his research. I will share some highlights from
					this newsletter, but suggest you may want to order it by calling this telephone number 1-800-527-3044. He avoids pharmaceuticals because of their side effects and since pharmaceuticals often
					treat symptoms not cause. He seeks to find the best natural remedies.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Four of the best antiviral compounds he has found are: 1) modified citrus pectin (MCP), 2) active hexose correlated compound (AHCC), 3) elderberry extract (Sambucol), and 4) high doses of
					vitamin D. These are all available on the web.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-1'>In his recommendations he shares:</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					I have started to take MCP every day (a 5-gram scoop of PectaSol-C from Econugenics in my morning protein shake). I want to have the anticancer, antiviral, and immune boosting benefits
					working all the time, not just during a crises.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					I also keep several bottles of AHCC (ImmPower from American BioSciences) on hand at all times. Although I don’t take it daily, it can be a true godsend for getting rid of the flu or any
					persistent infection.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					He encourages not “to resort to vaccines and/or antiviral medications, both of which can have some very serious side effects…” He also points out the importance of exercise. I like to think
					that we have physical muscles, spiritual muscles, and mental muscles. It is important to exercise all three. “Use it or lose it!” Nurture body, mind, and spirit and live the abundant life.
					My joke is that I like to learn faster than I forget! Balance in life, drinking in the beauties of nature with loved ones, sharing meals with family and friends, and exchanging thoughts and
					ideas are some of the simple a beautiful joys of life and can move us away from stress, worry, anxiety and fear.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-1 font-bold'>OUR EXPERIENCE WITH GRAPE-FRUIT SEED EXTRACT</p>
				<p className='mb-1 font-bold'>(GSE – a must in every medical kit)</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					My wife, Edna, and I were attending a preparedness expo in Salt Lake City some years ago, and she felt impressed to get three, 2 oz. bottles of GSE to take on our up-coming mission, which we
					served ‘97-‘99. The studies on GSE’s effectiveness were very good, and some of them had been done at BYU, showing that it was anti-bacterial and even anti-viral.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Because we were going to Cote d’Ivoir, West Africa, and most the natives have malaria, we were required to take one of three medications to counter the malaria problem – none of which would
					prevent it – but were believed to reduce the probability or seriousness. All three had significant side effects. We chose larium. It’s side effects, depression, were the least serious of the
					three.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					After about two months in Africa, we looked at each other, and said, “We don’t need this.” Learning French, adapting to a new culture, and being away from family were tough enough to deal
					with. We didn’t need to add depression.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Edna had read that GSE was anti-parasitical, so we deduced that it would work for malaria. We stopped using larium and started using GSE. It is very bitter, as one can well imagine – coming
					from concentrated grape-fruit seeds. The Nutribiotics brand, which we had, comes in vegetable glycerin and is very dense. If you put drops it in glass of water, the drops go right to the
					bottom of the glass.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We typically used about three to five drops per glass or about 15 drops per liter. Because it kills parasites along with many harmful bacteria, if I ever feel a cold coming on or a sore
					throat, we put five drops or so in a glass with a little water, then gargle with that; swallow it, and then follow it immediately with more water to wash down the bitter taste. That way, the
					bitter taste is short lived. Taking it in juice helps.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We were at the president of our Sunday School’s home of the Boeake 1 branch, Cote d’Ivoir. They had a baby daughter about a year old, who they were afraid was going to die because her
					malaria attack was so serious. Edna always carried the GSE with us in her purse, in case we had to drink water that was not pure, which was almost always the case when we were away from our
					apartment. She put 10 drops in about 1/2 liter of water and suggested they give it to their daughter mixed in some orange juice. Six days later on Sunday, they were all out to church, and he
					little girl was fine. Once the others learned of ‘Sister Allan’s’ magic medicine, they started to come up to her and would say, “Please give us some of your medicine, Sister Allan.” Only,
					they said it in French. So we started sharing it with others. There are no known side effects.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Taking too much is usually not an issue, because of its bitterness. Malaria, among the Ivorians, is near 100%. The mortality rate among the old and the young is very high. AIDS was also
					common.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The mortality rate in Cote d’Ivoir is about twice the international average. There they brag about their age as they get older. Because we were over 60, they really looked up to us just for
					that alone – besides being Americans – who they considerto be smart and rich. When you have next to nothing, rich is relative, and so all Americans look rich to them.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Our Mission Mother told us that on any given month 1/3rd of our missionaries were in the hospital. Once we found out its benefits, we started using it extensively with our missionaries as
					well. We know we gave away more than three bottles in volume, yet when we left we still had one bottle that was nearly full to leave with the missionaries. This apparent miracle brings to
					mind the scripture: “Neither shall the cruse of oil fail.” (1 Kings 17:14)
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					I am so grateful that my sweet wife listened to the Spirit, and that we had that GSE with us. It helped enormously. I see it as an essential ingredient for our medical kits as we go through
					the purging times ahead in preparing for the Savior’s glorious return. Mostly, I thank the Lord that He is always there to guide us and help us in our mortal journey – especially as we reach
					out in love to serve His children, whom He loves more than we know.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					One can buy GSE at health food stores, costing about $14/2 oz. bottle, or about $24/4 oz. bottle, which will last a long time – as it is very concentrated. It also comes in capsule form,
					which would help with the bitterness. Online one can find it in quantity quite a bit cheaper, if a group went together and bought it. The cheapest is to make your own by saving grapefruit
					seeds – drying them – powdering them, and then adding some vegetable glycerin as a base.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We have also made very inexpensive large quantities by buying citricidal by the gallon from: http://www.allhealthtrends.com/ for $300. They no longer sell the gallon size. Their largest
					quantity is 32 ounces (1 quart) for $225, so this is an enormous price increase. The Nutribiotics mixture ratio is 1 part citricidal to 3 parts vegetable glycerin. The citricidal is like
					pouring honey, so it is messy to do. On a group basis it may still be worthwhile. One way or another, everyone should have some.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-1 font-bold'>ECHINACEA</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>(The Miracle Herb that you can grow in your Garden)</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The following has been extracted from the book Nature’s Remedies, ECHINACEA, the plant that boosts your immune system by Douglas Schar. Echinacea: This herb works with the body to build your
					immunity system and works like an antibiotic – in contrast to an antibiotic which kills both good and bad bacteria in the body. Also, echinacea has been shown to be both anti-viral as well
					as anti-biotic. A list of the ailments and diseases with which it has been shown to be effective are listed below.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Echinacea causes the generation of interferon, white cells, and T-cells as it builds the immunity system. It basically can fight any infection or poison that afflicts the human body. You can
					buy it in a large variety of forms. It has become quite popular, and be aware that there are a large varieties and all are not the same. Echinacea Purpurea is often sold because it is
					cheaper, but more research is needed to know how effective it is. Echinacea Angustifolia has been demonstrated to be the most effective by an organization called the ECLECTIC SCHOOL OF
					MEDICINE, which started in 1845 and lasted for about 80 years – until antibiotics were discovered. Then antibiotics were thought to be the cure all, and the study and use of echinacea waned.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Echinacea is in the daisy family and there are eight different species. Some call it the cone flower. Echinacea Angustifolio grows in the Mississippi valley, and seems to be the most
					effective, but echinacea purpurea grows well in Utah and though it may not be as effective as Angustifolio, it is also effective. For an average adult, 300 mg*, 3 times per day, has been
					shown to be effective in treating an ailment. Smaller doses seem not to be as effective. Some of the Eclectics recommended 3 ml* per day of echinacea tincture or three grams of the fresh
					root. The fresh root is the best. It can be ingested directly, or it can be made into a tincture to preserve the freshness. Tinctures can be made quite easily. It can also be used topically,
					for example, as in treating a spider or rattle snake bite. For acute diseases the recommended dose is every ó hour and for chronic disease every 4 hours.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Amazingly, it can be used to treat both strep and staph infections. It fights the common cold and various kinds of flu, as well. The following is a list of where Echinacea Angustifolia has
					been used effectively:
				</p>
				<p className='mb-1 font-bold'>actinomycosis</p>
				<p className='mb-1 font-bold'>abscesses</p>

					By strengthening the immunity system, echinacea has the wonderful property of facilitating the digesting and getting rid of the harmful cells while at the same time assisting in the
					regeneration of the good cells.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>* 1,000 mg (1 gram) weighs the same as one cubic centimeter of water. A thousandth of a liter (ml) is the same as a cubic centimeter (cc).</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>Commercially, we like Dr. Richard Schulze’s “Echinacea Plus.” It is very effective. You can by this product by calling 1-800-herbdoc.</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>WHEAT GRASS JUICE</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>Wheat grass juice is excellent for boosting the immune system. It is one of the strongest tonics to move the body alkaline that there is.</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We have personal experience with wheat-grass juice. My wife was bed-ridden with arthritis several years ago, and 2 ounces of wheat-grass juice three to six times per day was extremely
					helpful in reversing this extremely painful disease for her. We mixed it with other vegetable juices to make a green drink. It is very strong by itself.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Wheat grass can be bought in many health food stores. It is very inexpensive and easy to grow wheat grass. The following link gives a good set of instructions:
					https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS8Xch0G0jM. If you raise it yourself, then having a good wheat-grass juicer is helpful. Otherwise, one can just chew it like a cow! The above youtube video
					link shows a special three-part sprouting container, which one can buy and would be useful. But this is not necessary as it is easy to sprout without this container, or if you don’t have
					access to the internet then you can do the following easily
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>Instructions:</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Rinse about a cup of wheat in a glass quart jar. After rinsing, cover the seeds with cool water. Cover it and leave it in a warm pace for ó a day. Rinse the wheat again; only drain off the
					water this time. Cover it, and leave it again in a warm place for another ó day. If you have viable wheat, it will have sprouted. Next you need something for the sprouted wheat to grow on.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We use a cafeteria tray with about a 3/4 inch (2 cm) of good soil on it. We run a finger around the perimeter to make a little ditch for water containment later. Wet the soil, then spread
					the sprouted wheat on the soil so that they are touching each other and sprinkle them with water. Then cover the tray with another tray inverted to make it dark for the sprouts, and leave it
					in a warm place.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Give sprouts a good watering each day. After about a couple of days, you will need to take the tray off the top so that the wheat may grow. Keep the tray out of the direct sunlight but in a
					warm place.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					After about a week, you will have beautiful green wheat sprouts about 4 to 6 inches tall (10 to 15 cm). You can harvest it with scissors at this time – cutting it off just above the seed,
					and put it in an airtight bag in the refrigerator for immediate use. Once you juice it, use the juice within 30 minutes as the live enzymes are most effective then. This is one of best
					immune system elixirs you can have. Mix it with other vegetable juices of your choice.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3 font-bold'>THE BEST CURE</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The best cure and prevention is the Lord’s. He knows the cure for every disease and will reveal that to our mind and hearts as we ask, seek, and knock. Millions of miracles have happened
					this way since time began and we will see many more in the purging and purifying times ahead.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The Lord’s ways and thoughts are not man’s ways and thoughts (Isaiah 55:8-9), so be open to unusual and different ideas that may come into your mind and heart. You can tell when the Lord is
					talking to you for the fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, and peace(Galatians 5:22), and Satan cannot replicate these.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The Lord has promised through the Apostle James and the Prophet Joseph Smith: Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with
					oil in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. (James 5:14-15)
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					And whosoever among you are sick, and have not faith to be healed, but believe, shall be nourished with all tenderness, with herbs and mild food, and that not by the hand of an enemy. And
					the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live
					unto me.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die, and more especially for those that have not hope of a glorious resurrection. And it shall come
					to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them; And they that die not in me, wo unto them, for their death is bitter. And again, it shall come to
					pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed. (D&C 42:43-48)
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The Lord knows the future and is willing and ready to be with us and to help us in whatever; for He sees the glorious end from the beginning and knows of our worth and potentiality. He has
					promised, and we can totally trust in Him:
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
					souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. (Matthew 11:28- 30)
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					He further promises in conjunction with a health code given in these last days as I also shared in the book that: And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in
					obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; And shall run and
					not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen. (D&C
					89:18-21)
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					How blessed we are to live in this day and time with all the signs of His glorious Second Coming. The Earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory, and those who hearken to His
					voice will be with Him at His coming in glory.
