					The opportunity to grow and to have a deeper appreciation of the value of the eternal truths of God, which appreciation we could not gain otherwise. Understanding and living harmoniously
					with these eternal truths of God brings science and religion into perfect harmony and brings us a fullness of joy in eternal life, as well as peace, love, and joy in this life.

				<p className='mb-3'>
					Because of God‚Äôs infinite love for us, He gave us His Only Begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him and lives His teachings shall have eternal life (John 3:16). Christ also gave us our
					conscience to ‚Äúlight‚Äù our way that we may know good from evil (John 1:9). At each decision point in life, we choose. As we choose the good, we synchronize our souls with the will of God;
					otherwise, we become more asynchronous and are estranged from God. Well did the Apostle James say, ‚ÄúTherefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.‚Äù (James
					4:17)
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					A loving and merciful God has given us the door of repentance made effective through the infinite atonement of Christ that we may resynchronize our souls with God. Also, in God‚Äôs love He has
					angels round-about-us to counter the adversary‚Äôs opposition. Taking from Shakespeare‚Äôs Othello, from Charles Dickens‚Äô Barnaby Rudge, Chapter 29, which Abraham Lincoln used in his inaugural
					address, let us choose our ‚Äúbetter angels,‚Äù who are whispering to us the best path for us. Can we imagine a higher path in life than going about ‚Äì best using our time and talents ‚Äì in doing
					good as we follow the light of Christ?

					This is ‚Äúthe still small voice‚Äù shared so profoundly in the Bible (1 Kings 19:12). Following this still small voice moves us to the path that aligns with the mission we agreed to do during
					our mortal journey and which will bring honor and glory to our loving Heavenly Father. With Him, in a pre-mortal epoch, we agreed and rejoiced in our opportunity to come to earth. As
					developed in Chapter 2 of It‚Äôs About Time, we had a very special interview with our Heavenly Father in which we jointly mapped out our life‚Äôs mission that we knew would be for our eternal
					best good. Because we have free agency, we can choose not to do our mission, but that path will not be the best for us.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					As we apply faith in the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives and repentance, which means changing our path direction to align with His will for us, we move our souls‚Äô clock closer to synchronism
					with Him. One can show mathematically that our frequency (our different world views) will move ever closer into perfect resonance with the Father through the Son as we move to be one with
					them and their teachings. This is the process of becoming ONE. With seven billion different world views, how can we become with God? The Lord gave me an equation showing how. The following
					simple equation will allow us to prove this ONEness concept, which equation is derived from an equation developed earlier in the paper, that our lack of resonance with God.

					This equation, as fully explained and illustrated below, mathematically, emotionally, spiritually, mentally, and physically shows how our souls can come into an ONEness with God. Our oldest
					son, Sterling, shared with me this fascinating experiment on how five independent metronomes are brought into synchronization
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In preparing the invited paper I presented at the international navigation conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, I included the following as part of it. This experiment gave me a great
					example so that I could illustratively share the message of the gospel with my international colleagues. They politely asked me to remove it as they didn‚Äôt want spiritual as part of a
					technical conference. For those interested, I share the write up below:

				<h5 className='text-xl font-bold'>n SYNCHRONIZATION AND SYNTONIZATION OF SOULS</h5>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					I saved the best for last in the following and last example and which also may be called ‚ÄúHow to resonate our souls with God.‚Äù We will see how synchronizing and syntonizing our souls with
					God has the greatly desired effect of ONEness (resonance) with Him. Whereas synchronization means same time, syntonization means same frequency or same tone. Two clocks can be syntonized and
					have very different times; they could be an hour apart in their time readings while running at the same rate. If syntonized but not sysnchronized, then the time-difference remains constant,
					and they are out of sync. Because the time error of a clock is the integral of the frequency error, sychronization guarantees syntonization. We will see this concept being very important as
					we develop how to resonate our souls with God.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					I discuss the fascinating MASER and LASER action ‚Äì invented by Nobel Prize winner Charles Townes, et. al. ‚Äî in Chapter 20 of my book, Maser and laser are acronyms meaning Microwave or Light
					Amplication by Stimulated Emmission of Radiation. In a hydrogen maser, when a hydrogen atom enters the resonant cavity of the maser in an excited-quantum-clock-transition-energy state, it is
					stimulated to give off its clock-transition photon in phase (synchronized and syntonized) with all the emissions of all the other atoms, which have already entered the cavity.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The photons of all the atoms are in resonance with each other. Because of this resonance phenomena, the time deviation TDEV time-tability plot improves as the square-root of the averaging
					time, ùùâ -1/2. This gives hydrogen masers their excellent short-term frequency and time stability. But, as explained in Chapter 20, for significant reasons, this ideal resonance phenomena
					does not persist. Analogously, these reasons will be important later in this example.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					There is an instructive illustration of resonance demonstrated in the following{' '}
					<a

						YouTube video
					</a>{' '}
					This experimenter shows five metronoms coming into resonance as they are coupled through a sounding-board. Notice, he first shows that they do not resonate until the coupling-sounding-board
					is free to operate among the metronoms. As explained in my book, if a TDEV time stability plot were made of the time-differences of the metronoms in this experiment, the stability would
					improve like the masers after resonance was achieved, but not before. This resonance phenomena was first observed by the famous inventor of the pendulum clock, Christiaan Huygens, back in
					the 1600s.

					Being a devout Christian and a scientist, I have pondered the apparent conflicts and lack of resonance between science and religion over my 79 years on this planet. A survey taken at the end
					of the last century showed that 93% of America‚Äôs major scientists were agnostic or atheists in their beliefs; they believed that good science excludes God and things spiritual. In my book,
					It‚Äôs About Time, the opposite message is developed. Truth does not contradict truth. True science and true religion will harmonize, and this is the main message of the book,
					www.ItsAboutTimeBook.com. I show that this harmony is brought about by using an expanded version of the scientific method (Chapter 1), which includes God and experimental data consistent
					with this expanded version as developed in chapters 2 and 3.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The moral decline in America and in much of the world is in large measure a result of the encroachment of secularism, humanism, and materialism on society. In the last century scientists and
					historians have chosen to exclude God and things spiritual. Using this expanded scientific method with some exciting new data, the book is a counter-attack to this encroachment. This
					counter-attack is accomplished by showing that living the law of love as taught by Christ is the answer to all of our problems and can and will bring about the harmony, oneness and goodness
					we all desire in an ideal society. This ideal is achieved when our actions resonate with the teachings of Christ and we are living the law of love. Our souls become synchronized and
					syntonized with God.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					As a scientific example of how this ideal society can come to be, consider the following. Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, Chauncey Riddle, develops in his book, Think Independently, the
					very important concept that because of agency (free choice), if there are seven billion people on this planet, then there are seven billion different ‚Äúworld views.‚Äù The law of love moves us
					to respect that each is entitled to his/her own world view.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Then we have the summation and powerful High Priest‚Äôs prayer in the Bible in the gospel of John Chapter 17 just before He (the Christ) worked out the infinite and all encompassing atonement
					for all of Heavenly Father‚Äôs children.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The core message of this prayer, which is the core message of the Christian faith, is that as we come to believe in and live Christ‚Äôs teachings, we will become one with Christ (in harmony
					and resonating with eternal truth) even as Christ and the Father are one. And Christ begins this profound prayer with the identity that eternal life is to know the Father and the Son ‚Äì
					wherein is a fullness of joy and which is the main purpose of our mortal journey.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					This oneness seems a contradiction to Professor Riddle‚Äôs thesis that each of us has a different ‚Äúworld view,‚Äù but I will show with a scientific illustration that the gospel of Jesus Christ
					is the ‚Äúgood news.‚Äù For me it is the best news, because living Christ‚Äôs gospel brings about this most desired oneness and great harmony we desire in society. This scientific illustration is
					a fun one for me, because it relates to my life-long work with clocks, which I have been working with for 56 years! Suppose each of us is like a clock. One can show that if measured with
					enough precision, every clock disagrees with every other clock, except at some moment when two clock readings may crossover. This disagreement comes as a result of chaotic noise perturbing
					each clock‚Äôs time and rate ‚Äì each clock has a different frequency (clock rate) and time. This is like each person having a different ‚Äúworld-view.‚Äù And this is like the masers being perturbed
					by other influences and their performance degraded from the ideal.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We were all born innocent, and our clocks were all in synchronism with God at our birth. Then as our mortal clocks started ticking when we began our journey in life, we became asynchronous
					due to our challenges in life and our world views diverged from the perfect world view of God. As developed in Chapter 2 of It‚Äôs About Time, these challenges are for our growth if we keep
					our focus on God. Opposition is an essential part of Heavenly Father‚Äôs perfect plan of happiness, which seems to be a big contradiction, but you will see that opposition preserves our agency
					‚Äì giving us the right to choose between good and evil. Opposition and life‚Äôs challenges give us the opportunity to grow and to have a deeper appreciation of the value of the eternal truths
					of God, which appreciation we could not gain otherwise. Understanding and living harmoniously with these eternal truths of God brings science and religion into perfect harmony and brings us
					a fullness of joy in eternal life, as well as peace, love, and joy in this life.

				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					This mission was designed to best help us during our mortal journey and which will bring honor and glory to our loving Heavenly Father. In that pre-mortal epoch, we rejoiced in our

					that our lack of resonance with God is given by , where xN represents our last decision point. At that point, did we choose to follow Christ or otherwise? God is ever there to hear our
					prayer and to know our thoughts and the intents of our hearts, as explained in Chapter 22 of It‚Äôs About Time.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					We can synchronize our thoughts and actions with Him through prayer and pondering, studying or listening to His word. It is exciting to know that in our desires to synchronize our will to
					His that each of us has a unique mission, given our different times on earth and our different talents. In His infinite wisdom, He knows our uniqueness and will customize the inspiration
					given to each of us for our eternal best good. His will is to have each of us return to Him and receive a fullness of joy, but know that He will not force us; such force would violate our
					freedom to choose, and He will never do that. As we treasure up His word and hearken to it, on our Nth occasion to do so, we move xN closer to synchronism as we align our will to His. If we
					choose otherwise, we move our clock further away from the ‚Äúcorrect time.‚Äù
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					Like the sounding-board for the metronomes needs to be ‚Äúfree‚Äù to facilitate resonance among the metronomes, so we need to get out of the noise of the world and find the freedom in communion
					with God that will open our minds and hearts to the still small voice. His loving arms are stretched out continually to all of us in His infinite capacity to do so that we may find resonance
					with Him sthrough faith in Christ and repentance from sin.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The denominator in the above equation, N ùùâ avg, is the time we have ticked off on earth. N is the number of decisions we have made, and ùùâavg is the average time between decisions.
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					The denominator ever grows larger and the numerator can be made smaller and smaller as we synchronize our wills to the will of the Father, as the Son did perfectly. One can show that this
					equation converges to perfect resonance; we grow into an oneness with God and are guaranteed eternal life in that process. Our world views become aligned with His perfect world view. His
					promise is, ‚ÄúYe shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.‚Äù (John 8:32).
				</p>
				<p className='mb-3'>
					In that unity we become free of sin as individuals, and free from bondage as a society. We become one with God in that ideal society motivated by pure love, and each of our time and talents
					is thus utilized fully to the betterment of that society in time and in eternity. We model our society after the harmony of the Godhead. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost each have different
					missions within the Godhead, but they are one ‚Äì motivated by pure and perfect love, They move the cause of Truth forward throughout the universe. Following this perfect model is how, as
					Jesus has asked us to pray, that Father‚Äôs kingdom comes on earth as it is in heaven. Could there be a more exciting message ‚Äì a society based on the pure love of Christ, which will inherit a
					fullness of joy?
